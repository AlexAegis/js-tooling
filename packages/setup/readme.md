# @alexaegis/setup

A CLI tool that sets up package tooling based on its archetype and enabled
plugins.

An example would be that for a package that is defined as a "svelte library
built using vite" will receive tooling configurations, npm scripts, dependencies
that are applicable to that archetypical package.

TODO: move this to another repo
