## Services

### CI

- Create a `ci.yml` file based on the one [here](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Replace the `artifacts` array at the `publish` step to filter out what you
  want to publish on npm
- Once it ran once, add a badge displaying its status on your
  [`readme.md`](../readme.md) file from
  <https://github.com/AlexAegis/js/actions/workflows/ci.yml>, click on the
  `Create status badge` option in the menu. (Or modify the one you found here by
  hand)
